# Kill Count

**Act [NEKO]** - So you don't have to open stats menu every single time to check how many player you killed

**Jaid [LGBT]** - i would've said you can do this with happy textures, and you can... but it doesn't update upon destroying an icon ðŸ’”

**Jaid [LGBT]** - @Alphalaneous would it be possible to make the player_destroyed_stat label variable update upon destroying icons?

**Alphalaneous** â€” try  "lock-attributes": true it's an undocumented way to run something every frame until I have some better control over that stuff

**Jaid [LGBT]** - where exactly should i put it? bc everywhere i've tried putting it doesn't work

**Alphalaneous** â€” In attributes

**Alphalaneous** â€” But if it doesn't work it's prolly broken then 

**Alphalaneous** â€” Never really paid much attention to it testing wise

**Alphalaneous** â€” Since it is more of an experimental hack

**Jaid [LGBT]** - yea it didn't work when in attributes

**Alphalaneous** â€” I'll add some sort of schedule attribute that lets you schedule something for x times a second (empty being every frame) 

**Jaid [LGBT]** - aight

**Jaid [LGBT]** - mostly at least, sometimes it updates if i go out of and back into gd 

**Jaid [LGBT]** - unless that just happens regardless of lock-attributes being there but idk

**Alphalaneous** â€” No clue honestly lol

**Alphalaneous** â€” Some future plans are now scheduling, variables, cascading UI changing, and more if statement control

**Jaid [LGBT]** - :FakeNitroEmoji:

**Alphalaneous** â€” Next goal is to be able to make a working DVD screensaver with HT haha

**Jaid [LGBT]** - ðŸ”¥

**Jaid [LGBT]** - finally, dvd screensaver tp

**Nwo5** - soooo got bored so overcomplicated this idea into a mod
